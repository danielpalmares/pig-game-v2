## Rules 

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his **ROUND** score.
- **BUT**, if the player rolls a 1, all his **ROUND** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his **ROUND** score gets added to his **GLOBAL** score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on **GLOBAL** score wins the game.
